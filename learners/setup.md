## Docker containers

You will be using the Python container as instructed in the [Docker lesson](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshopqcd-2024-lesson-docker/03-docker-for-cms-opendata.html#python-tools-container).

You are expected to have worked though the CMS open data example in that python container as instructed in the [Dataset scouting lesson](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshopqcd-2024-lesson-dataset-scouting/05-what-is-in-the-data.html#inspect-datasets-with-python-tools).
